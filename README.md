# Harry Potter Giftastic

## Overview

There is a new course being offered at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry... Magical GIFs! This site utilizes REST APIs in order to provide the user a unique experience. After the user “prepares” a spell, they can then use it display an assortment of GIFs from Giphy's Rest API. The user can then “sort” themselves using information drawn from both the Harry Potter API and Giphy. The site features Harry Potter theme, with logos of my own design, as well as a series of font faces the fit the overall design goal.

## Coding Practices

The technologies utilized include HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and REST APIs.
